MaternityTopics documentation
=============================

This project was initiated by a request by Dr Kasia Kuleszewicz to:

    ...conduct[ing] overlap checks for the key themes recently scoped by the 
    Maternity Disparities Consortium. They have identified six themes they 
    propose to work on. To support the decision-making process, we are 
    mapping these topics against the NIHR portfolio.

The project was split into two parts:

1. Use keyword search to search through all Infrastructure Study Titles.

2. Use semantic search to search through all Infrastructure Theme descriptions.

This site describes the work involved in item #2.
